# PizzaGout
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) pizza ordering system developed with Vue.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It uses MySQL for data storage and Redis for session management.  
The system enables users to browse a menu, manage their cart and place orders, with RESTful APIs supporting CRUD operations on products, carts, and items.
